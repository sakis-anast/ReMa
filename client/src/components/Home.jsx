      The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has severely affected the global economy. Major victims of the
COVID-19 outbreak, as studies show, were small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One of the main response
strategies for most of the enterprises was introducing Remote Work to their employees/businesses. While there are still
no precise figures on the scale of teleworking during the COVID crisis, there are some early estimations that suggest a
much larger prevalence than before the crisis. An ad hoc online survey from Eurofound (2020) estimated that close to
40% of those currently working in the EU began to telework full-time as a result of the pandemic. More specifically,
according to the EU Joint Research Center analysis (jrc120945), the prevalence of remote work varied strongly across
sectors and occupations and was already particularly high in knowledge- and ICT-intensive services.
Business managers and leaders especially those of SMEs, have to deal with new challenges related to coordinating a
team across multiple office locations and managing full-time remote workers. However, the training system is not
prepared for the challenges and considerations of managing remote teams. The training market, however, has not yet
caught up with these challenges as only 15% of remote employee managers have received specialized training (the
“2020 State of Remote Work Report”.)
The objective of the project “Remote Management”, is to promote the acquisition of competences of SMEs managers, in
the adoption of remote management strategies and the use of related tools. For addressing this objective, the following
specific objectives (aims) have been set:
SO1. A systematic review of the practices on remote management tools and strategies
SO2. MOOC (Massive Online and Open Course) on remote management


The expected outcomes (R) include:
R1- Review of the practices on remote management tools and strategies
R2- Reporting on remote management readiness of SME's in partners' regions,
R3 -Skills needed list for SMEs managers, to adopt an effective remote management strategy,
R4- Curriculum development in line with ECVET procedures
R5- MOOC (Massive Online and Open Course) in line with EQAVET, for upskilling SMEs managers in remote
management adoption.

existing training for ensuring that managers in SMEs can effectively adopt remote management strategies and tools.
-CREATING NEW, INNOVATIVE CURRICULA and COURSES. A new curriculum and respective online course, will be
developed for
- OVERCOMING SKILLS MISMATCH AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE LABOUR MARKET and addressing
